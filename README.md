**Pan-cancer Analysis of Trans-effects from Copy Number Amplifications**

This repository contains the code for the paper "Pan-cancer Analysis of Trans-effects from Copy Number Amplifications." Each directory has a "notes" file that details the contents of that directory and how to use them. To navigate the repository in the same order as referenced in the paper, please visit the directories in this order:

 - findingCNVs
 - transEffects
 - pathways

Also included in this repository are the results of an exploration into GBM cancer, which were not included in the paper. We include these results here with the hope that they may be useful to other researchers.
